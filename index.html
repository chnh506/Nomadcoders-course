      <p class="header__description">
        “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
        most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others
        may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't
        necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

        Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by Brandon
        Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is recommended
        you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

            When I was a kid my favorite activity was going to our local video
            store, The Video Station, and perusing the Horror section for as
            long as my mother would allow. I would scan the familiar covers and
            squeal when I stumbled onto something I hadn’t noticed before. Then
            there were other videos. Videos that were always there, never
            checked-out. Videos you’ve historically glazed over based on some
            quality or taste issue with the cover art (XTRO), title (Killer
            Klowns From Outer Space), or both (Chopping Mall)1. The Taking of
            Deborah Logan was this type of film for me. I added it to my
            wishlist but promptly deprioritized it based on some quick
            assumptions: It’s a found-footage film, and I was experiencing some
            level of fatigue for the sub-genre; the cover art felt lazy and
            unoriginal; I didn’t recognize any names attached to the project;
            and nobody I know had ever mentioned it. Months later a fellow
            Horror superfan I know and respect wrote about the film, saying it
            wasn’t at all what she expected and how pleasantly suprised (and
            shocked) she was. Based on her glowing recommendation I gave it a
            look, and I’m so glad I did. The premise (“documentary” about
            elderly Alzheimer’s woman descending into the depths of dementia… or
            is she?) doesn’t always go down so easily, primarily due in equal
            parts to the writing as well as the performance by lead Jill Larson.
            When things go left and the drama/horror is ramped up she absolutely
            thrives, going all in. It’s in the quieter moments that I have a
            tough time really accepting her delivery. I also wish there was a
            clearer delineation between what is and what may not actually be
            dementia. But there are a few effective, shocking, and inventive
            segments that I think really elevate this film and make it something
            actually kind of special.

              Turns out later in life I would love many of those films for the
              very reasons I originally thought I would hate them then.
